# SENG474-Data-Mining

This repo is for our Data Mining course where we successfully completed a machine learning algorithm that predicts Hall of Fame inductees of the NBA. Multiple data sets were used, cleaned, and merged together to gain the most valuable data for more accurate predictions. 

The entire process and results can be seen in the report.ipynb file.
